# 🛰 BEAM & CIVIL BEAM

BEAM & CIVIL BEAM is the way to produce raw LAW output.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** A portion of the early LAW is also generated by the PoPuk pool, after which the PoPuk pool's revenue is generated by the eco-loop.
{% endhint %}

### Core BEAM Pools

The core BEAM pool is the only way to produce LAW in the early days, and it is suitable for SSNS systems. The speed of the core BEAM pools is determined and they are designed to ensure the core functionality of the BlockNG system.

After all legacy pools are closed, **All The LPs must be in LawSwap.**
